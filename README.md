# Hashing-with-a-salt-pepper
Python code to secure sha512 using a salt and pepper. 

# Secure Hashing:
    Hashing is an important feature of cybersecurity. It allows passwords not to be stored 
    in plain-text keeping them safe from hackers. However, many hashing algorithms have been 
    cracked leaving the passwords potentially vulnerable to attackers. This code implements a 
    unique 32 byte salt and a static 34 byte pepper to make the hash value unique and secure.
    
# Usage:
    This project was created in order to farmiliarize myself with hashing and securing it. 
    Feel free to use any aspect of my code and implement it into your own, but I suggest 
    randomly generating a new pepper.
